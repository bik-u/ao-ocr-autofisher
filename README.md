# Auto Fisher

This program is meant to be educational and not actually be used since it can get you banned.

PS: It's sometimes unreliable but I think it will work almost everytime.

## HOW TO AFK

Go on fullscren and turn graphics down to 1.

Make sure character is shift-locked, facing the ocean.

Required camera position is pressing 'o' twice after going in first person.

It will NOT work if camera position is wrong, the mask is very sensitive to white and other colors similar to fish alert icon.
