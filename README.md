# Auto Fisher

Auto fishes in Arcane Odyssey using OCR to analyze screenshot footage.
It takes a screenshot every second so not that slow.

This program is meant to be educational and not actually be used since it can get you banned.

PS: It's sometimes unreliable but I think it will work almost everytime.

## HOW TO AFK

    - Make sure your camera is looking towards the ocean (opposite of recoil)

    - Go in your ship and wedge yourself between a cannon. Ex. below

# TODO

    - Add actual recoil support
    
    - Add a way to edit various settings (prob yaml file or gui program)
