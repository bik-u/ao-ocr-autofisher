# Auto Fisher

Auto fishes in Arcane Odyssey using OCR to analyze screenshot footage.
It takes a screenshot every second so not that slow.

This program is meant to be educational and not actually be used since it can get you banned.

PS: It's sometimes unreliable but I think it will work almost everytime.

## HOW TO AFK

    - Make sure your camera is looking towards the ocean (opposite of recoil)

    - Your character starts slight away from a wall straight behind you.

The recoil needs to be stopped by a wall.

It presses forward slightly so your fishingrod does not get stuck in the wall behind you.

# TODO

    - Add actual recoil support
    
    - Add a way to edit various settings (prob yaml file or gui program)
